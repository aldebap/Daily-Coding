# Problem of reversing a string

Consider a string composed of letters and symbols.
Write a function to reverse only the letters, keeping the symbols where they are.

For example:

            given | return
------------------+------------------
          "ab-cd" | "dc-ba"
"shg?ikr!rufaw++" | "waf?urk!kighs++"
